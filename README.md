Delay Socket
=============

A simple `portforward` utility that allows to artificially increase the connection latency.

This utility is meant to provide a controlled environment to test scenarios that require
'low enough' latency to be usable in practice. 

By artificially bumping up the latency you can experiment with different latency values
and determine the breaking point.
